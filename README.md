# MSA A* Algorithm

MSA A* is a Python implementation of the A* algorithm within the context of Multi-Source Agreement (MSA). This algorithm is used for pathfinding and optimization in various applications, including robotics, gaming, and network routing.

## A* Algorithm

The A* algorithm is a popular pathfinding algorithm used in artificial intelligence and robotics. It efficiently searches for the shortest path between two points on a graph, taking into account both the cost of moving between nodes and the heuristic estimate of the remaining distance to the goal.

## Implementation

This project provides a Python implementation of the A* algorithm, allowing users to find optimal paths in graphs or grids. The implementation includes:

- A* algorithm core logic
- Heuristic function for estimating the remaining distance to the goal
- Example usage and demonstration

## Usage

To use the MSA A* algorithm:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/msa-astar.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd msa-astar
   ```

3. Run the Python script containing the A* algorithm implementation.

4. Provide input data such as the graph or grid, start and goal nodes, and any additional parameters as required.

5. The algorithm will compute the optimal path and output the result.
